  title: About Us
  description: "With the vision of creating a sustainable world without textile and
    plastic wastes, it became necessary for us at Planet 3R to reduce the landfill
    space by recycling clothes and nylons. \n\nIn my quest to creating more impact,
    I realized many people in my community usually dump textile and plastic wastes
    by the road side while some even go to the extent of burning them thereby depleting
    the ozone layer which is hazardous to our health and environment thus prompted
    me to use my weaving skills at Jokelinks to create an innovative solution by starting
    planet 3R initiative."
  content: "Planet 3R is a social enterprise dedicated to converting textile and plastic
    wastes into eco-friendly products using the 3R ( Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) to save
    our planet Earth by weaving them into innovative items. \n\n"
